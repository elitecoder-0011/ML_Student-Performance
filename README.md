# Student Performance
This is a Machine Learning course project to predict the final year grade 'G3' of Student Performance Dataset. 

**ML CATEGORY:** Regression

The course project is divided into Phase-1 and Phase-2. 

+ **Phase-1:** The grade 'G3' is predicted by different Machine Leanring models using the default settings. 
	- **CODE:** Course Project/Phase 1/Student_Performance_Phase1.ipynb 
	- **DATA:** Course Project/Phase 1/data/student-mat.csv 
                   
+ **Phase-2:** The grade 'G3' is predicted after tuning the hyperparameters of the machine learning models. 
	- **CODE:** Course Project/Phase 2/Student_Performance_Phase2.ipynb 
	- **DATA:** Course Project/Phase 2/data/student-mat.csv
